Influential/SYM members/LS of/IN the/DT House/RBS Ways/NNPS and/CC Means/LS Committee/LS introduced/LS legislation/LS that/WDT would/MD restrict/VB how/WRB the/DT new/JJ savings-and-loan/LS bailout/LS agency/LS can/MD raise/VB capital/UH ,/, creating/VBG another/LS potential/LS obstacle/UH to/TO the/DT government/NN 's/POS sale/NN of/IN sick/SYM thrifts/LS ./.
The/DT bill/NN ,/, whose/WP$ backers/LS include/LS Chairman/LS Dan/LS Rostenkowski/LS (/-LRB- D./NNP ,/, Ill./LS )/-RRB- ,/, would/MD prevent/VB the/DT Resolution/NNP Trust/LS Corp./LS from/LS raising/# temporary/LS working/LS capital/LS by/LS having/VBG an/LS RTC-owned/LS bank/LS or/LS thrift/LS issue/LS debt/LS that/WDT would/MD n't/RB be/VB counted/VBN on/IN the/DT federal/JJ budget/NN ./.
The/DT bill/LS intends/VBZ to/TO restrict/VB the/DT RTC/NNP to/TO Treasury/# borrowings/LS only/UH ,/, unless/IN the/DT agency/NN receives/LS specific/LS congressional/LS authorization/LS ./.
``/`` Such/UH agency/LS `/LS self-help/UH '/LS borrowing/LS is/LS unauthorized/JJ and/LS expensive/JJ ,/LS far/RB more/RBR expensive/LS than/LS direct/LS Treasury/LS borrowing/UH ,/, ''/'' said/VBD Rep./LS Fortney/LS Stark/LS (/-LRB- D./NNP ,/, Calif./LS )/-RRB- ,/, the/DT bill/NN 's/POS chief/JJ sponsor/LS ./.
The/DT complex/LS financing/LS plan/NN in/IN the/DT S&L/RBS bailout/LS law/LS includes/LS raising/LS $/$ 30/CD billion/CD from/IN debt/# issued/VBN by/IN the/DT newly/RBS created/LS RTC/LS ./.

Another/DT $/$ 20/CD billion/CD would/MD be/VB raised/VBN through/LS Treasury/LS bonds/NNS ,/, which/WDT pay/LS lower/JJR interest/NN rates/NNS ./.
