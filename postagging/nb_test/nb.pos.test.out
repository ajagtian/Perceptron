Such/SYM legislation/LS must/MD be/VB enacted/VBN by/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN the/DT month/NN ./.
The/DT Senate/LS bill/LS was/LS pared/LS back/RP in/IN an/DT attempt/NN to/TO speed/# deficit-reduction/LS through/LS Congress/LS ./.

To/PDT the/LS delight/JJS of/IN some/DT doctors/NNS ,/, the/DT bill/NN dropped/VBD a/SYM plan/NN passed/VBN by/IN the/DT Finance/NNP Committee/LS that/WDT would/MD have/VB overhauled/VBN the/LS entire/RBS physician-reimbursement/LS system/LS under/LS Medicare/LS ./.
